# Rosee (31th of August, 2023 release notes)

See https://adrien-lenglet.fr/project/rosee for screenshots and commentary over this awesome project!  

Aside from that, I experimented with a lot of different rendering techniques on this project. The most convincing ones are showcased on my website. To build Rosee, use the MinGW-w64 toolchain with `make` and `g++`. Make sure to have the Vulkan SDK installed for Windows. The code should work under Linux with minimal porting efforts.

I'm pretty happy with the code of this project. There were some really early game prototypes with messy main functions, but 99% of the value of this project resides in the Vulkan renderer. I think it turned out good with most of the data-oriented patterns and rendering pipeline. There is little to no commentary, I did not write any of this with the intent of disclosing it at the time. Today I'm thinking, why not let's just get it out there. So there it is!

After this project I mostly worked on private IP until September, 2023 so this is the most up-to-date showcase I can provide as for now!
